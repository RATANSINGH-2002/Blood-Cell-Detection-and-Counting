# Blood-Cell-Detection-and-Counting Using YOLOV5 and Streamlit Application

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the YOLOv5 model for Blood Cell Detection and Counting. The model is trained on a custom dataset with a goal to detect and count blood cells in microscopic images. YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, is used to achieve fast and accurate detection results.

Original Dataset available at [here](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset).It has 689 non-annotated images.

The Preproccessed Dataset as per YOLOv5 model is Available at [here](https://github.com/bala-codes/Yolo-V5_Object_Detection_Blood_Cell_Count_and_Detection/tree/master/dataset-preprocessed).After pre-proccessing the images, we split images into 363 training dataset and 326 as valid dataset.

This project uses YoloV5n model.

Run the code step-by-by as mention in Colab Notebook.

The end results are interfaced by Creating an Streamlit Application.Important Note: It only takes JPG images
