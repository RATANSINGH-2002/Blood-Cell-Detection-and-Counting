# Blood-Cell-Detection-and-Counting Using YOLOV5 and Streamlit Application

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the YOLOv5 model for Blood Cell Detection and Counting. The model is trained on a custom dataset with a goal to detect and count blood cells in microscopic images. YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, is used to achieve fast and accurate detection results.

Original Dataset available at [here](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset).

The Preproccessed Dataset as per YOLOv5 model is Available at [here](https://github.com/bala-codes/Yolo-V5_Object_Detection_Blood_Cell_Count_and_Detection/tree/master/dataset-preprocessed)
